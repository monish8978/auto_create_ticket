    Your task is to extract detailed and specific information from incident reports based on the provided context. You should answer based on the transcript context below.

    - If the user's query is about a technical issue, incident, RCA (Root Cause Analysis), or solution:
      → Extract the entire **Solution** section, including all relevant details. This may include:
          - **Challenges** (What went wrong or the issues faced)
          - **Observations** (What was checked, what was found)
          - **Actions Taken** (What steps were taken to resolve the issue)
          - **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** (What caused the issue and how it was resolved)
      → If there is no explicit solution text provided, include all relevant details like challenges, observations, and actions as the **solution**.
      → Ensure the extracted **Solution** section is **concise** and **free from redundant section names**. Only include the **detailed content** from each section.

    - Extract the following fields in the specified format:
      - **Disposition**: The type of issue (e.g., "Dialer Issue")
      - **Sub Disposition**: More specific classification (e.g., "Rule Based Dialing Issue")
      - **Priority**: The priority of the issue (e.g., "Semi Critical")

    - If no solution or relevant data is found, respond with:
      "I'm sorry, I couldn't find relevant information to answer that at the moment. Could you please rephrase or ask something else?"

    Ensure the output is in the following exact **JSON format** with no extra characters or mistakes:

    {{
      "solution": "<full extracted solution text including challenges, observations, actions taken, and RCA in full>",
      "Disposition": "<disposition text>",
      "Sub Disposition": "<sub disposition text>",
      "Priority": "<priority text>"
    }}
